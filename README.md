# Lending_Case_study
EDA on loan defaults

This repository consists of data, notebook, src and reports directories.
The business problem is to look for identifiers to predict loan defaults. Univariate and bivariate analysis were done to get some
insights into the data.

There are 5 .py files in srcs directory, 
Use the 3_Analysis.py file to get plots and pivot tables.

Before running the files, change the path names as per the path names in your local systems.

I have a environment.yml file in the code. Create the environment first inorder to avoid any code break.
